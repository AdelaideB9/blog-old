In this challenge, we are given a single binary called recur, so like any good CTFgoer, we ran the program. On doing so, it would print *utflag{* and then idle. Opening up Ghidra and analysing the binary, we located the main function and saw that it would get a character from an array called *flag*, run a function called *recurrence*, and then print a character. For reference, this is the following code:

```c
int recurrence(int param_1)
{
  int iVar1;
  int iVar2;
  
  if (param_1 == 0) {
    iVar1 = 3;
  }
  else {
    if (param_1 == 1) {
      iVar1 = 5;
    }
    else {
      iVar1 = recurrence(param_1 + -1);
      iVar2 = recurrence(param_1 + -2);
      iVar1 = iVar2 * 3 + iVar1 * 2;
    }
  }
  return iVar1;
}

undefined8 main(void)
{
  byte bVar1;
  byte bVar2;
  int local_1c;
  
  local_1c = 0;
  while (local_1c < 0x1c) {
    bVar1 = flag[local_1c];
    bVar2 = recurrence();
    putchar((int)(char)(bVar2 ^ bVar1));
    fflush(stdout);
    local_1c = local_1c + 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

where

```
int flag[] = {118, 113, 197, 169, 226, 34, 216, 181, 115, 241, 146, 40, 178, 191, 144, 90, 118, 119, 252, 166, 179, 33, 144, 218, 111, 181, 207, 56};
```

It's important to note that recurrence took a parameter however, the function call in the main function is not displaying one. Taking a look into the disassembly, we can see that the character value was being moved into the EAX preceded by

```
  IMUL EAX,EAX
  MOV EDI,EAX
  CALL recurrence
```

Thus we're squaring each character of the flag and moving the result into the EDI to be the first argument to recurrence.

Considering that the program was correctly printing the first few characters of the flag, it was likely that we needed to optimise the program. So rewriting the code above in python we get

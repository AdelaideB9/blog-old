## notes

I may not be familiar with .mem files but memory forensics, and more specifically [volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility "https\://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility") seems like its going to be our friend here. 

Starting with `volatility -f image.mem imageinfo` we get `Win7SP1x64` as our top suggested profile, providing confirmation that we've got a valid dump.

Using one of volatility's coolest features we can use `mkdir shots && volatility -f image.mem --profile=Win7SP1x64 screenshot --dump-dir=shots` to get the following wire-frame screen shot from memory. Now we know that the flag was probably open in Notepad, given the hint "There wasn't any suspicious network activity or anything... it's almost as if they just had their passwords up right on the screen." 

To grab the contents from Notepad we'll want to 

`volatility -f image.mem --profile=Win7SP1x64 pslist`

`volatility -f image.mem --profile=Win7SP1x64 memdump --dump-dir=./ -p 2696`

`cat 2696.dmp | strings | grep UMASS` 

No luck, a few more greps later and its pretty clear that either the flag's not there or its encoded in format that would make it difficult to find by simply searching through strings. 

From here a bit of intuition and luck might lead you to the idea that the user may have copied the flag from Notepad onto their clipboard. 

`volatility -f image.mem --profile=Win7SP1x64 clipboard`
